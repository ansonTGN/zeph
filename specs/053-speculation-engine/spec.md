# Spec: SpeculationEngine — Speculative Tool Execution

> [!info]
> Reduces tool-dispatch latency by pre-executing tool calls before the LLM finishes
> generating them. Two complementary strategies share one bounded cache and one sweeper.
> Landed across PRs #3636, #3640, #3647, #3651, #3654.

## 1. Overview

### Problem Statement

Tool dispatch is synchronous with the LLM generation stream: the agent waits for the
full tool-call JSON to arrive, then executes. For deterministic or near-deterministic
tools (read-only filesystem reads, shell commands with known args), this is wasted
latency — the arguments are often known from partial SSE output, or predictable from
skill activation patterns.

### Goal

Pre-execute tool calls speculatively while the LLM is still generating, so that when
the confirmed call arrives the result is already cached. On a commit hit, the confirmed
call returns the pre-computed result immediately.

### Out of Scope

- Speculative writes to shared mutable state that cannot be rolled back
- Any form of dry-run execution (confirmation is a pure policy query, not a sandbox run)
- Speculation on tools from untrusted skills
- Speculation in channels where trust cannot be established

---

## 2. Speculation Modes

`SpeculationMode` is an enum in `zeph-config`:

| Variant | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `Off` (default) | No speculation; engine is a no-op |
| `Decoding` | SSE stream — `PartialJsonParser` accumulates tokens; `try_dispatch` fires when all required JSON fields are complete |
| `Pattern` | PASTE — `try_dispatch` fires at skill-activation time using historical invocation sequences from SQLite |

Both modes share the same `SpeculationEngine::try_dispatch` / `try_commit` API and the same `SpeculativeCache`.

---

## 3. Functional Requirements

| ID | Requirement | Priority |
|----|------------|----------|
| FR-SE-001 | WHEN `mode = off` THE SYSTEM SHALL perform no speculative work — no allocations, no background tasks beyond the sweeper | must |
| FR-SE-002 | WHEN `mode = decoding` THE SYSTEM SHALL parse partial SSE tool-call JSON via `PartialJsonParser::push()` and call `engine.try_dispatch()` as soon as all required fields (`tool_id`, `params`) are parseable | must |
| FR-SE-003 | WHEN `mode = pattern` (PASTE) THE SYSTEM SHALL call `engine.try_dispatch()` at skill activation with a `PredictionSource::SkillActivation` prediction | must |
| FR-SE-004 | WHEN `try_dispatch` is called AND `trust_level != Trusted` THE SYSTEM SHALL skip dispatch and return `false` | must |
| FR-SE-005 | WHEN `try_dispatch` is called AND `executor.requires_confirmation_erased(&call)` returns `true` THE SYSTEM SHALL skip dispatch, increment `skipped_confirmation` metric, and return `false` — no tool is executed | must |
| FR-SE-006 | WHEN `try_dispatch` is called AND all gates pass THE SYSTEM SHALL execute the tool in a background task via `TaskSupervisor::spawn_oneshot`, store the handle in `SpeculativeCache`, and return `true` | must |
| FR-SE-007 | WHEN `try_commit` is called THE SYSTEM SHALL look up the cache by `(tool_id, args_hash, context_hash)`; on a hit, await the handle result and return it; on a miss return `None` | must |
| FR-SE-008 | WHEN `end_turn` is called THE SYSTEM SHALL cancel all in-flight handles via `CancellationToken` and reset `SpeculativeMetrics` | must |
| FR-SE-009 | WHEN the sweeper interval fires (every 5 s) THE SYSTEM SHALL evict handles whose `ttl_deadline` has passed | must |
| FR-SE-010 | WHEN `SpeculationEngine` is dropped THE SYSTEM SHALL abort the sweeper task and cancel all cache handles | must |
| FR-SE-011 | WHEN a `ToolStartEvent` is emitted for a speculatively dispatched call THE SYSTEM SHALL set `speculative: true` on the event | must |

## 4. Safety Invariants

1. **Trust gate first.** `try_dispatch` returns `false` immediately when `trust_level != Trusted` — before any tool metadata is read.
2. **Confirmation gate is a pure policy query.** `executor.requires_confirmation_erased(&call)` is a metadata read; it does NOT execute the tool. No double side-effects.
3. **Speculative dispatch uses `execute_tool_call`, never `execute_tool_call_confirmed`.** There is no fenced-block bypass.
4. **All handles are cancelled at turn boundary.** `end_turn()` calls `cache.cancel_all()`. No handle outlives its turn.
5. **Sweeper shares the same cache inner `Arc`.** The sweeper operates on the live handle set, not a stale snapshot (C2 invariant).
6. **Cache is bounded.** `max_in_flight` (config, default 8) is enforced by `SpeculativeCache::insert`; when full, the oldest handle is evicted and its task aborted.
7. **TTL is per-handle.** Default `ttl_seconds = 30`. The sweeper enforces TTL independently of turn boundaries.

---

## 5. Config Schema

```toml
[tools.speculation]
mode                = "off"     # "off" | "decoding" | "pattern"
max_in_flight       = 8         # max concurrent speculative handles
ttl_seconds         = 30        # per-handle TTL (sweeper enforced)
confidence_threshold = 0.7      # minimum Prediction.confidence to dispatch
```

---

## 6. Metrics (`SpeculativeMetrics`)

Collected per turn and reset by `end_turn()`:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `committed` | Handles that matched and returned a cached result |
| `cancelled` | Handles cancelled (mismatch, TTL, turn end) |
| `evicted_oldest` | Handles evicted because `max_in_flight` was saturated |
| `skipped_confirmation` | Calls skipped because `requires_confirmation` returned `true` |
| `wasted_ms` | Total wall-clock ms spent in cancelled speculative work |

## 7. Wiring

### SSE Decoding Path (`mode = decoding`)

```
LLM SSE stream
    │
    ▼
stream_drainer::drain_stream()
    │  PartialJsonParser::push(token)
    │  → if complete_tool_args → engine.try_dispatch(prediction, trust_level)
    │
    ▼
normal tool dispatch → engine.try_commit(call)
    │  hit  → return cached result
    │  miss → executor.execute_tool_call(call)
```

### PASTE Path (`mode = pattern`)

```
skill activation boundary (assembly.rs:1284)
    │
    ▼
observe_paste_transition(native.rs:3576)
    │  predict likely next tool calls from SQLite
    │  → engine.try_dispatch(prediction, trust_level)
    │
    ▼
normal tool dispatch → engine.try_commit(call)
```

---

## 8. Key Invariants

- NEVER dispatch speculatively when `trust_level != Trusted`
- NEVER use `execute_tool_call_confirmed` (fenced-block path) for speculative dispatch
- NEVER retain in-flight handles beyond turn boundary — `end_turn()` is mandatory
- NEVER reuse a stale TTL-expired handle — sweeper evicts them within 5 s
- NEVER share a sweeper operating on an empty clone of the cache (the sweeper arc is the same as the engine's cache arc)
- NEVER set `speculative: false` on `ToolStartEvent` when the call originated from speculative dispatch

---

## 9. Acceptance Criteria

- `cargo nextest run -p zeph-core -E 'test(speculation)'` passes
- A `mode = decoding` session: SSE tool-call tokens accumulate in `PartialJsonParser`; `try_dispatch` fires before the LLM finishes; `try_commit` returns the cached result (committed counter > 0)
- A `mode = pattern` session: PASTE activation calls `try_dispatch`; committed counter reflects hits
- An untrusted skill call: `skipped_confirmation` or dispatch skipped entirely; no speculative task spawned
- After `end_turn()`: `cache.is_empty()` is `true`; metrics reset to zero
- `SpeculationEngine` drop: sweeper task aborted without panic (both supervised and raw paths)
- `ToolStartEvent { speculative: true }` appears in the event stream for a speculative dispatch
- `mode = off`: no background tasks spawned; `is_active()` returns `false`
